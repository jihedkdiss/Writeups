# The Bigger Picture Writeup

**Description:**

Reverse Engineering isn't always about attention to detail. Sometimes, all you have to do is *look at the bigger picture*.

## Solution

This is a warmup task inspired by [Chris Domas's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlUe0TUHOIc) at DEF CON 23 where he demonstrates how a programâ€™s control flow graph (CFG) in IDA Disassembler can be visualized as an image. You can make your own using his open source [tool](https://github.com/Battelle/REpsych) just like I did.

1. We open the binary in IDA Free or Pro.
2. We increase the `Max number of nodes` limit in IDA settings to something like `100000`:

        Options > General > Graph > Max number of nodes

3. We look at the flow chart:

        View > Graphs > Flow chart

4. There is our flag! ðŸŽ‰

The goal of this challenge is to encourage players and reverse engineers to examine the flow chart, not just the pseudocode. Plus, it's pretty cool Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

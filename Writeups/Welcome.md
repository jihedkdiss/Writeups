# Welcome Writeup

**Description:**

Start with this easy challenge and good luck!

**Attachement:**
[welcome](Files/welcome)

## Solution

This is a warmup task to test your Linux skills. The flag is stored as plain text in a string inside the executable. You just need to use the `strings` command to reveal it. You can also combine it with the `grep` command to find the flag faster: `strings welcome | grep Securinets`.
